Welcome to the official Go implementation of the [Poly Network](https://www.poly.network/) !

Poly is a blockchain system providing cross-chain interactive services. Your transaction on chain X can be relayed to other chain Y and executed, we call this kind of transaction as `cross-chain transaction`. Any chain which implement Poly cross-chain interactive protocol can join the poly ecosystem. For now, we have *Ethereum, Ontology, Switcheo, Neo and Bitcoin*. You can transfer asset from one chain to another. Like *ETH, BTC, ONT, ONG, ERC20, OEP4, NEO etc*, and any message between different chains.

## Features
- Highly optimized transaction processing speed
- Multiple encryption algorithms supported
- Quick block generation time 1s
- Support for heterogeneous and homogeneous chains
- Supports cross chain transaction consistency and finality
- Supports variety of heterogeneous chain protocol (Bitcoin/Ethereum/Neo/Ontology/Cosmos-SDK)

## Install from Binaries

Downloading a specific version from the [release section](https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/releases).

## Build From Source

### Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.14 or later

### Build

Note that the code in the `master` branch may not be stable.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/polynetwork/poly.git
cd poly
make all
```

After building the source code successfully, you should see the executable program `poly`. 

### Build Docker Image

You can build a poly docker image pre-installed the ploy executable program.

```
make dockerImg
```

You would find the image `polynetwork/poly` and you can run a container from it.

## Run Poly

The Poly CLI can run nodes for the MainNet, TestNet and local PrivateNet. 

Before you can run the node you will need to create a wallet file. A wallet file named `wallet.dat` can be generated by running

```shell
./poly account add -d
```

Here's an example of the directory structure

``` shell
$ tree
└── poly
    ├── poly
    └── wallet.dat
```

### MainNet Sync Node

Before you start node, you need to register your account to be a **relayer** to get permission to send transactions to Poly. 

You can run an Poly MainNet node built from the source code with:

```shell
./poly
```

### TestNet Sync Node

Before you start node, you need to register your account to be a **relayer** to get permission to send transactions to Poly. 

You can run an Poly TestNet node built from the source code with:

```shell
./poly --networkid 2 
```

### Local PrivateNet

The Poly CLI allows you to run a local PrivateNet on your computer. To start the PrivateNet built from the source code with:

```
./poly --testmode  
```
